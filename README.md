# The 60% ⭐

Why the 60% ? Because I was setting up this machine and gone clearly fine with
60% of setups added ( WELL KEEP IT SIMPLE 😍). I moved to Artix because I
have not updated my Arch for about 4 months and things changed so fast, well to
be honest though, I saw somebody on YouTube whom called **Luke Smith**. He is an
ultra-cool boomer 😎.  

Artix did not use any systemd things. So it is absolutely free from that, well
application that depends on the thing would be broken if there isn't fix yet. I
chose the `runit` system over `openrc` and `s6`. There is no reason why ( these
three options are the same, well just a little bit different on seconds ). It
doesn't matter, things will done in a blink of an eye. 🤪

Gonna love this new machine! Awesome! ❤️

# Progs and stuffs 📚

  0. `yay` over `pacman`. ( **obligatory** 👿 )
  1. `dwm` the best window manager ( was using `i3gaps` and I moved on ).  
      I used Lukesmith's [DWM](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwm) config and
      changed things a little bit ( like colors, shortcuts, etc ).
  2. `dwmblocks` also from Luke, you can view those things
     [here](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks). Its a bar module with custom things monitored.  
     Compatible with his `dmenu` that you can get it right
     [here](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dmenu). I removed some modules and added my special `spotipai` module.
  3. `st` you can guess it, its from luke
     [also](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) with my special color setup.
  4. `iceberg.vim` is the color enabled across the machine. Created by the
     mighty Cocopon! go [here](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim). 🌈
  5. `nvim` choosed to be my editor ( almost 3 years I got clinged by this guy! 😛 ).
  6. `zsh` is my got-to-go shell as well with the `oh-my-zsh` things.
  7. `starship` is my prompt, theme provided by omz is suck btw.
  8. `dunst` is my notification watcher!
  9. `maim` to capture things.
  10. `picom` is the newer compiz ( X display compositor ).
  11. `brave` as the `$BROWSER`, chrome could not protect you, neither firefox.
  12. `spotify`, .... it is clear. ( multi-platform things ).
  13. `lf` as my file manager.
  14. And many more...

# Settings ⚙️

  All things related to path are stored inside my `.zprofile`, things related to
  my prompt goes into `.config/zsh/.zshrc`, and things related to configs are
  stored in `./config`.  

  You could choose another WM or even DE, put those in `.xinitrc`. ( I am a fan
  of typing `startx` on the TTY screen on the boot.... so yea 😜).
